# About me
## My interests are doing activities outside and listening to music. I also love plants and animals!
## Websites I recommend
  - ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) I think Linkedin is a great website to use to help you connect to others and you can learn more insights.
  - ([ESpn](https://www.espn.com/)) For me personally I enjoy reading up on the latest news for my favorite sports teams on this website.
