## Websites I reccomend
  - ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)) I think Linkedin is a great website to use to help you connect to others and you can learn more insights
  - ([ESpn](https://www.espn.com/)) For me personally I enjoy reading up on the latest news for my favorite sports teams on this website
